# Big_Bazar_Billing_C++project

INTRODUCTION ABOUT PROJECT :-

The project is on Big Bazar Billing System. Big Bazar is the place where customers come to purchase their daily using products and pay for that. Therefore, there is a need to calculate how many products are sold and to generate the bill for the customer.
“Big Bazar Billing System” aims at developing in software that can be used at places like shopping malls, big bazars, supermarkets to easily manoeuvre the daily task of taking the order, calculating the bill etc.
The main advantage of this project is that it converts all the manual work which is time consuming and error prone to fully automated system which helps in eliminating all the paper work, saves time, improves customer services. It also speeds up various processes such as addition of new items to the menu, deletion of items from the menu, modification of details of items and calculation of bills thus providing convenience to the workers as well as customers.
In the development of the project, selection of an appropriate programming language and a platform is of primary importance. The major part of the credit goes to the software environment chosen by the developer.
Selection of a language from the ocean of languages is very difficult, a developer has to consider various features and functionalities that a particular language can provide.
In this language C++ language is used to maintain all the data. It provides many features like file handling, data can be easily maintained and many features that are required while doing a project.

CONCLUSION :-

We have tried to develop a system that can be great help for the owner of the referred Big Bazar for making bill for the customer. Despite of all our efforts here are some bugs in the system, which are still to be removed. This is possible by testing being done in the system. We have left all the options open so that if there is any other future requirement in the system by the user for the enhancement of the system then it is possible to implement them.
In the end we wish to say that computers should be put to such use where not only their capabilities are fully exploited but, what is more important, serve the society by raising the standard of living of people, thereby making the world better place to live and work in.
